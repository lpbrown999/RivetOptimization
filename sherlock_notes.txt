##Notes on how to use sherlock

1) In windows powershell, start a ubuntu terminal "ubunut"


## Data transfer

1) CD into my job files. Since we are in ubuntu it is the mounted drive 
	"/mnt/c/users/lpbro/gitrepos/RivetOptimization/JobFiles" 

2) scp <source_file_path> <username>@<remote_host>:<destination_path>'
# ~ indicates user directory. so /home/users/lpbrown/JobFiles is ~/JobFiles
# to copy "scp /path/to/my/file lpbrown@login.sherlock.stanford.edu:~/folder/filename"
# to retrieve "scp lpbrown@login.sherlock.stanford.edu:~/folder/filename /path/to/local/filename"


## Thoughts
# Think about how maybe I should have my python script create a bash job rather than a subprocess.

#Could be like "bash script -> abaqus cae nogui=script.py", generates inp
#Then next bash script -> abaqus job=Job-1, runs job
#Then next bash script -> abaqus cae=script.py, loads from odb
